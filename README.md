# EDC's happy.js
Everyday Creative wants to maintain happy.js because EDC is happy with happy.js  
The original maintainers/developers of happy.js seem to be on permant leave (2+ years as of this date). 
This is EDC's attempt to maintain a Happy.js fork that integrates outstanding pull requests to the main branch that hasn't been accepted and correct any issues encountered upon using happy.js
##Happy.js â€“ are your forms happy? Just ask 'em!
